1. Identify

2. Plan

3. Design

4. Build 
* All members will create their sections of the project according to their user stories
* Variables will have descriptive names and use camelCase to ensure code readability and consistency throughout all parts
* Parts will be built as modules, ensuring they can be easily connected once all parts have been developed and tested
* Use appropriate error handling so users don't see error codes and broken pages/screens

5. Test
* Once development is finished for a user story, test to ensure that all of the defined acceptance criteria are met
* Where relevant, test to ensure each part displays properly in user interface
* Test all input fields thoroughly

6. Deploy
* Once all user stories for each member are developed and tested, merge all parts together to create working software
* Start another round of testing to ensure all modules are working together properly
* Begin entering hypothetical user data to ensure functionality and that user data is stored and retrieved correctly

7. Maintain
* If bugs are present after deployment, attempt to fix them quickly
* Clean up any leftover testing data that may interefere with user experience
* Add functionality as time permits
