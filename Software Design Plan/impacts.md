Our software aims to provide quality-of-life features to aid both beginner and experienced lifters in their strength or hypertrophy journeys. 
For beginners, figuring out how to plan and structure a training cycle can be quite the daunting task with a deluge of conflicting or hard to piece together information online. To ameliorate this, 
our software provides a variety of beginner-friendly templates with a selection of recommended exercises to make starting off a new training plan easy.
Likewise, for intermediate or advanced lifters, our software provides a comprehensive set of features that should provide for all of their needs. Exercises can be swapped out on the fly, 
any combination of exercises can be used to craft a custom training plan, and the schedule can be tailored to their needs.

By providing all of these basic needs, while also implementing automatic progression features from week to week, as well as progression tracking in the user's profile, our software 
eliminates the struggles of training plan design and makes it easy to set, analyze, and achieve one's fitness goals.
